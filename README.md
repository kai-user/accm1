# Kubernetes azure-cloud-controller-manager

## Status
Currently the directory 'pkg/azureprovider' is periodically synced from [Kubernetes upstream directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/azure). If you have Kubernetes Azure cloud provider related change, please go to [Kubernetes upstream](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).The upstream directory will be moved here after issue [Standalone Azure cloud provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/50752) is done.

## Overview
`Kubernetes azure-cloud-controller-manager` is a Kubernetes component that supports interoperability with Azure cloud platform. It runs together with other master components to provide the Kubernetes clusterâ€™s control plane.

[Kubernetes cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager) is a Kubernetes component designed for running controllers that would interact with various cloud platforms. It operates with the cloud through [Kubernetes cloud provider interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/cloudprovider/cloud.go), meanwhile different cloud platforms would have corresponding implementations of the cloud provider interface.

This project provides an Azure specialized version of `Kubernetes cloud controller manager`: it depends on Kubernetes project and builds upon [cloud-controller-manager/app](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cmd/cloud-controller-manager/app). This project also incorporates [Azure cloud provider](pkg/azureprovider), which implements `Kubernetes cloud provider interface` using [azure-sdk-for-go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go).

## Usage
`Kubernetes azure-cloud-controller-manager` will release container image at [location TBD](#), and can be run as containers. For development, you could also build a standalone binary and run.

We also recommend using [acs-engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine) to deploy Kubernetes cluster, which supports deploying `Kubernetes azure-cloud-controller-manager` for Kubernetes v1.8+, see [doc TBD](#) for details.
